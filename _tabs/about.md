Hello! I am Islam. An EEE student interested in Embedded Systems and Circuit Design. I enjoy deconstructing existing systems to truly understand how they work and how they can be improved, or building new ones from the ground up :D

Past experience with microcontrollers (Arduinos, ESP32), Circuit Design (KiCAD), Circuit Simulation (LTspice). Iâ€™m looking for opportunities to contribute to hands-on projects, research and internships.
